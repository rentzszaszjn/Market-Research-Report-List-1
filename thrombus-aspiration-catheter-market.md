<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thrombus Aspiration Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Type</li><li>Lumen Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thrombus aspiration catheter market encompasses two main types: hydrophilic type and lumen type. Hydrophilic catheters feature a special coating that enhances glide and minimizes friction, improving navigation through blood vessels. They are particularly effective in cases of complex thrombus retrieval. Lumen type catheters have a more traditional design focused on maximizing suction efficiency and optimizing thrombus removal within larger vessel lumens. Both types serve critical roles in minimally invasive procedures for successfully treating thromboembolic events.</p></p>
